Your task:
You will be given a network topology. Your job is to understand the structure and answer the questions that follow about the system and its architecture.
Use the format shown in the examples to give your answers, do not add additional, inconsistent or unrelated information.

Definitions:
Console: A computer equipped with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, allowing operators to interact with a system.
Switch: A networking device that connects multiple computers or devices, efficiently managing data traffic within a network.
Workstation: A high-performance computer.
NAS: (Network Attached Storage) A dedicated storage device connected to a network, allowing multiple users to store and access files remotely.
Server: A powerful computer that provides services or resources to other computers, managing data, applications, or networks.

Naming rules: All components with numbers in their names (e.g., Console-1, Console-2) are distinct devices. The number is critical for identification.
- Multi-device components: Use '{device}-{device number}' (e.g., Console-2).
- Single device components: Use the base name (e.g., Server, Switch).
- Network interfaces: Append '-{interface}' (e.g., Workstation-1-eth0, NAS-eth1).
- Switch ports: Use '{Switch}-port-{port number}' (e.g., Switch-port-14, Switch-port-7).

Network components:
Switch with its own 24 ports, from 1 to 24.
Console-1 and Console-2 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1 with its own network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.

Network topology:
The Console-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-1.
The Console-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-2.
The NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-11.
The Workstation-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-12.
The Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-port-13.
The Server-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-24.
All unspecified device, ports and interfaces are not connected to any device.

Q&A examples:
What is connected to Switch-port-5?
There is nothing connected to Switch-port-5.

What is connected to Console-3-eth0?
The Switch-port-3 is connected to Console-3-eth0.

What is connected to Switch-port-17?
The Workstation-3-eth1 is connected to Switch-port-17.

What is connected to NAS-eth1?
There is nothing connected to NAS-eth1.

Is there a connection between Server and Workstation-1?
Yes, there is the connection Server-eth0 to Switch-port-24 and Switch-port-12 to Workstation-1-eth0 or also Switch-port-13 to Workstation-1-eth1.

Is there a router in the system?
No, there is no router in the system architecture. 

What is connected to Workstation-3-eth2?
The Workstation-3 does not exist.

What is connected to Switch-port-14?
The Workstation-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-14.

What is connected to Console-3-eth0?
The Switch-port-3 is connected to Console-3-eth0.
