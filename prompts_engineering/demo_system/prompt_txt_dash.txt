Your task:
You will be given a network topology. Your job is to understand the structure and answer the questions that follow about the system and its architecture.
Use the format shown in the examples to give your answers, do not add additional, inconsistent or unrelated information.

Definitions:
Console: A computer equipped with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, allowing operators to interact with a system.
Switch: A networking device that connects multiple computers or devices, efficiently managing data traffic within a network.
Workstation: A high-performance computer.
SBC: (Single Board Computer) A compact computer with all essential components (CPU, memory, I/O) integrated onto a single board, used in embedded systems.
NAS: (Network Attached Storage) A dedicated storage device connected to a network, allowing multiple users to store and access files remotely.
Server: A powerful computer that provides services or resources to other computers, managing data, applications, or networks.

Naming rules: All components with numbers in their names (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3, SBC-2) are distinct devices. The number is critical for identification.
- Multi-device components: Use '{device}-{device number}' (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3).
- Single device components: Use the base name (e.g., Server, NAS).
- Network interfaces: Append '-{interface}' (e.g., Workstation-1-eth0, NAS-eth1).
- Switch ports: Use '{Switch}-{switch number}-port-{port number}' (e.g., Switch-1-port-14, Switch-3-port-7).

Network components:
Switch-1, Switch-2 and Switch-3 with 24 ports each.
Console-1, Console-2 and Console-3 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1, Workstation-2 and Workstation-3 each with its own two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
SBC-1, SBC-2 and SBC-3 each with its own network interfaces eth0, eth1 and eth2.

Network topology:
The Console-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-1.
The Console-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-2.
The Console-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-3.
The Server-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-24.
The NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-13.
The NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24.
The Switch-1-port-12 is connected to Switch-2-port-1.
The Switch-3-port-12 is connected to Switch-2-port-12.
The Workstation-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-2.
The Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-3.
The Workstation-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-4.
The Workstation-2-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-5.
The Workstation-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-6.
The Workstation-3-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-7.
The SBC-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-9.
The SBC-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-6.
The SBC-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-3.
All unspecified device, ports and interfaces are not connected to any device.

Q&A examples (report questions and answer exactly with the Q&A format, without specifying other information):
What is connected to Switch-2-port-5?
The Workstation-2-eth1.

What is connected to Console-3-eth0?
The Switch-1-port-3.

What is connected to NAS-eth1?
The Switch-2-port-24.

What is connected to Switch-3-port-6?
The SBC-2-eth0.

What is connected to Workstation-3-eth2?
The eth2 network interface does not exist for Workstation-3.

What is connected to SBC-2-eth1?
Nothing.

What is connected to Switch-2-port-12?
The Switch-3-port-12.

What is connected to Switch-1-port-14?
