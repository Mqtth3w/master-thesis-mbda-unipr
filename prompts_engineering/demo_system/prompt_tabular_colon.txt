Your task:
You will be given a network topology in a tabular format. Your job is to understand the structure and answer the questions that follow.
Use the format shown in the examples to give your answers, do not add additional, inconsistent or unrelated information. Use the table to understand and trace connections.

Critical Rules:
1. Connections are bidirectional: If one device says it's connected to another, the other must also list the same connection. Every connection appears twice in the table (A→B and B→A).
2. Interface validation:
   - If an interface does NOT exist (e.g., Workstation-3-eth2), answer: "The {interface} network interface does not exist for {device}".
   - If an interface exists but is unconnected, answer: "Nothing".
3. Naming syntax:
   - Devices with numbers (e.g., Switch-1, Switch-2, Console-3, SBC-2) are different from each other, especially devices of the same type.
   - Interfaces are named like {device}:{interface} (e.g., Switch-1:port-14, Server:eth0).

Network components:
Switch-1, Switch-2 and Switch-3 with 24 ports each.
Console-1, Console-2 and Console-3 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1, Workstation-2 and Workstation-3 each with its own two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
SBC-1, SBC-2 and SBC-3 each with its own network interfaces eth0, eth1 and eth2.
Unspecified components do not exist. While existing components, not specified in the following connection table, are not related to other devices/interfaces.

Connections table:
