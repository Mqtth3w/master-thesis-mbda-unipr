Your task:
You will be given a network topology. Your job is to understand the structure and answer the questions that follow.
Use the format shown in the examples to give your answers, do not add additional information.

Naming rules: All components with numbers in their names (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3, SBC-2) are distinct devices. The number is critical for identification.
- Multi-device components: Use '{device}-{device number}' (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3).
- Single device components: Use the base name (e.g., Server, NAS).
- Network interfaces: Append ':{interface}' (e.g., Workstation-1:eth0, NAS:eth1).
- Switch ports: Use '{Switch}-{switch number}:port-{port number}' (e.g., Switch-1:port-14, Switch-3:port-7).

Network components:
Switch-1, Switch-2 and Switch-3 with 24 ports each.
Console-1, Console-2 and Console-3 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1, Workstation-2 and Workstation-3 each with its own two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
SBC-1, SBC-2 and SBC-3 each with its own network interfaces eth0, eth1 and eth2.

Network topology:
The Console-1:eth0 is connected to Switch-1:port-1.
The Console-2:eth0 is connected to Switch-1:port-2.
The Console-3:eth0 is connected to Switch-1:port-3.
The Server:eth0 is connected to Switch-1:port-24.
The NAS:eth0 is connected to Switch-1:port-13.
The NAS:eth1 is connected to Switch-2:port-24.
The Switch-1:port-12 is connected to Switch-2:port-1.
The Switch-3:port-12 is connected to Switch-2:port-12.
The Workstation-1:eth0 is connected to Switch-2:port-2.
The Workstation-1:eth1 is connected to Switch-2:port-3.
The Workstation-2:eth0 is connected to Switch-2:port-4.
The Workstation-2:eth1 is connected to Switch-2:port-5.
The Workstation-3:eth0 is connected to Switch-2:port-6.
The Workstation-3:eth1 is connected to Switch-2:port-7.
The SBC-1:eth0 is connected to Switch-3:port-9.
The SBC-2:eth0 is connected to Switch-3:port-6.
The SBC-3:eth0 is connected to Switch-3:port-3.
All unspecified device, ports and interfaces are not connected to any device.
