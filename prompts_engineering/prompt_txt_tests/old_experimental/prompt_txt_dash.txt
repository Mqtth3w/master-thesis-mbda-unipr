Your task:
Understand the following network topology and answer all the questions with the format used in the examples to verify your network understanding.

Definitions:
Console: A computer equipped with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, allowing operators to interact with a system.
Switch: A networking device that connects multiple computers or devices, efficiently managing data traffic within a network.
Workstation: A high-performance computer.
SBC: (Single Board Computer) A compact computer with all essential components (CPU, memory, I/O) integrated onto a single board, used in embedded systems.
NAS: (Network Attached Storage) A dedicated storage device connected to a network, allowing multiple users to store and access files remotely.
Server: A powerful computer that provides services or resources to other computers, managing data, applications, or networks.

Notes and naming conventions: All components with numbers in their names (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3, SBC-2) are distinct devices. The number is critical for identification.
- Multi-device components: Use '{device}-{device number}' (e.g., Switch-1, Console-3).
- Single device components: Use the base name (e.g., Server, NAS).
- Network interfaces: Append '-{interface}' (e.g., Workstation-1-eth0, NAS-eth1).
- Switch ports: Use '{Switch}-{switch number}-port-{port number}' (e.g., Switch-1-port-14, Switch-3-port-7).

Network components:
Switch-1, Switch-2 and Switch-3 with 24 ports each.
Console-1, Console-2 and Console-3 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1, Workstation-2 and Workstation-3 each with its own two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
SBC-1, SBC-2 and SBC-3 each with its own network interfaces eth0, eth1 and eth2.

Network topology:
The Console-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-1.
The Console-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-2.
The Console-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-3.
The Server-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-24.
The NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-13.
The NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24.
The Switch-1-port-12 is connected to Switch-2-port-1.
The Switch-3-port-12 is connected to Switch-2-port-12.
The Workstation-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-2.
The Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-3.
The Workstation-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-4.
The Workstation-2-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-5.
The Workstation-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port-6.
The Workstation-3-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-7.
The SBC-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-9.
The SBC-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-6.
The SBC-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-3.
All unspecified device, ports and interfaces are not connected to any device.

Q&A examples:
Q: What is connected to the Switch-1-port-8? A: Nothing.
Q: What is connected to the SBC-1-eth0? A: It is connected to the Switch-3-port-9.
Q: What is connected to the Workstation-2-eth2? A: The eth2 network interface doesn't exists for the Workstation-2.
