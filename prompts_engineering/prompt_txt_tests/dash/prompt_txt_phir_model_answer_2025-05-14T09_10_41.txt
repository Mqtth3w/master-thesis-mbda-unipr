MODEL ANSWER:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to refer back to the network topology provided. Let me start by summarizing the connections based on the given information.

First, the network components and their connections:

- **Switches**: Switch-1, Switch-2, Switch-3 each have 24 ports.
- **Consoles**: Console-1, 2, 3 each have eth0 connected to Switch-1 ports 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- **Workstations**: Workstation-1 has eth0 and eth1 connected to Switch-2 ports 2 and 3. Workstation-2 has eth0 and eth1 connected to Switch-2 ports 4 and 5. Workstation-3 has eth0 and eth1 connected to Switch-2 ports 6 and 7.
- **Server**: Server-eth0 connected to Switch-1-port24.
- **NAS**: NAS-eth0 connected to Switch-1-port13, NAS-eth1 connected to Switch-3-port24.
- **SBCs**: SBC-1-eth0 to Switch-3-port9, SBC-2-eth0 to Switch-3-port6, SBC-3-eth0 to Switch-3-port3.
  
Other connections:
- Switch-1-port12 connected to Switch-2-port1
- Switch-2-port12 connected to Switch-3-port12
- Switch-2-port2 connected to Workstation-1-eth0
- Switch-2-port3 connected to Workstation-1-eth1
- Switch-2-port4 connected to Workstation-2-eth0
- Switch-2-port5 connected to Workstation-2-eth1
- Switch-2-port6 connected to Workstation-3-eth0
- Switch-2-port7 connected to Workstation-3-eth1
- Switch-3-port9 connected to SBC-1-eth0
- Switch-3-port6 connected to SBC-2-eth0
- Switch-3-port3 connected to SBC-3-eth0

Now, let's go through each question step by step.

1. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-9?**
   - Looking at the connections, Switch-1-port9 isn't directly listed. The NAS is on port13, and the Server on port24. The other ports 1,2,3 are taken by consoles. There's no mention of port9 being connected to anything. So answer is nothing.

2. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-9?**
   - Switch-2 has ports up to 24, but the connections listed are up to port5 for workstations. Port9 isn't mentioned. Also, Switch-2-port9 isn't connected to anything else. So answer is nothing.

3. **What is connected to Console-1-eth0?**
   - Console-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port1.

4. **What is connected to Server-eth1?**
   - Server only has eth0 connected to Switch-1-port24. No eth1 mentioned. So answer is nothing.

5. **What is connected to SBC-3-eth1?**
   - SBC-3 has eth0 connected to Switch-3-port3. No eth1. So nothing.

6. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-13?**
   - NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port13.

7. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-1?**
   - Switch-1-port12 is connected to Switch-2-port1. So the other end of port1 on Switch-2 is connected to Switch-1-port12.

8. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-15?**
   - No connections listed for Switch-2 beyond port7. So nothing.

9. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-5?**
   - Switch-1's ports 1,2,3 are consoles. Port13 is NAS. Port5 isn't mentioned. So nothing.

10. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-8?**
    - No connections here. Nothing.

11. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-16?**
    - Switch-2's ports beyond 7 aren't mentioned. Nothing.

12. **What is connected to SBC-3-eth0?**
    - SBC-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port3.

13. **What is connected to Workstation-3-eth0?**
    - Workstation-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-2-port6.

14. **What is connected to Workstation-2-eth1?**
    - Workstation-2-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port5.

15. **What is connected to Workstation-1-eth1?**
    - Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port3.

16. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-6?**
    - No direct connections listed. Nothing.

17. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-13?**
    - No connections mentioned. Nothing.

18. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-4?**
    - No connections. Nothing.

19. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-12?**
    - Switch-2-port12 is connected to Switch-3-port12.

20. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-20?**
    - No connections. Nothing.

21. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-16?**
    - Nothing.

22. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-10?**
    - Nothing.

23. **What is connected to Workstation-3-eth1?**
    - Workstation-3-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port7.

24. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-5?**
    - No connections. Nothing.

25. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-22?**
    - Nothing.

26. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-3?**
    - Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port3.

27. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-19?**
    - Nothing.

28. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-21?**
    - Nothing.

29. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-23?**
    - Nothing.

30. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-3?**
    - Console-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port3.

Let me double-check each to ensure I didn't mix up any ports. For example, Switch-1-port12 connects to Switch-2-port1, which is correct. Similarly, Switch-2-port12 connects to Switch-3-port12. All other ports not mentioned in the topology are unconnected. The key is to cross-reference each port with the list of connections provided. Looks like all answers are either specific devices or 'nothing' based on the given topology.
