MODEL ANSWER:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to refer back to the network topology provided. Let me start by summarizing the connections based on the definitions and naming rules given.

First, the network components:

- Switches: Switch-1, Switch-2, Switch-3 each have 24 ports.
- Consoles: Console-1, Console-2, Console-3 each have eth0.
- Workstations: Workstation-1, 2, 3 each have eth0 and eth1.
- Server: Has eth0.
- NAS: Has eth0 and eth1.
- SBCs: SBC-1, 2, 3 each have eth0, eth1, eth2.

Now, the topology connections as listed:

1. Console-1-eth0 → Switch-1-port-1
2. Console-2-eth0 → Switch-1-port-2
3. Console-3-eth0 → Switch-1-port-3
4. Server-eth0 → Switch-1-port-24
5. NAS-eth0 → Switch-1-port-13
6. NAS-eth1 → Switch-2-port-24
7. Switch-1-port-12 → Switch-2-port-1
8. Switch-3-port-12 → Switch-2-port-12
9. Workstation-1-eth0 → Switch-2-port-2
10. Workstation-1-eth1 → Switch-2-port-3
11. Workstation-2-eth0 → Switch-2-port-4
12. Workstation-2-eth1 → Switch-2-port-5
13. Workstation-3-eth0 → Switch-2-port-6
14. Workstation-3-eth1 → Switch-2-port-7
15. SBC-1-eth0 → Switch-3-port-9
16. SBC-2-eth0 → Switch-3-port-6
17. SBC-3-eth0 → Switch-3-port-3
18. All unspecified ports/interfaces are not connected.

Now, let's go through each question step by step.

1. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-21?**
   - Looking at the list, Switch-3-port-21 isn't mentioned in any connection. So, nothing is connected.

2. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-18?**
   - Switch-1 has ports 1-24. Port 18 isn't listed in the connections. So, nothing.

3. **What is connected to Console-1-eth0?**
   - From connection 1: Switch-1-port-1.

4. **What is connected to Workstation-2-eth1?**
   - Workstation-2 has eth0 and eth1. Eth1 connects to Switch-2-port-5 (connection 12). So, answer is Switch-2-port-5.

5. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-24?**
   - NAS-eth1 connects to Switch-2-port-24 (connection 6). Wait, no: NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24. So answer is NAS.

Wait, but the question is about Switch-2-port-24. Let me check. The NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24. So the device connected to Switch-2-port-24 is NAS. But wait, the NAS has two interfaces: eth0 and eth1. So NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24. So the port 24 on Switch-2 is connected to NAS. So answer is NAS.

Wait, but the NAS is a device. So the port on Switch-2-port-24 is connected to NAS. So the answer is NAS.

Wait, but the NAS is a device. So the port on Switch-2-port-24 is connected to NAS. So the answer is NAS.

Wait, but the NAS is connected via eth1 to Switch-2-port-24. So the port on Switch-2-port-24 is connected to NAS. So the answer is NAS.

But let me check again. The NAS has two network interfaces: eth0 and eth1. The NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-1-port-13 (connection 5), and NAS-eth1 is connected to Switch-2-port-24 (connection 6). So Switch-2-port-24 is connected to NAS. So the answer is NAS.

6. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-7?**
   - Workstation-3-eth1 connects to Switch-2-port-7 (connection 14). So answer is Workstation-3-eth1.

7. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-6?**
   - SBC-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-3-port-6 (connection 16). So answer is SBC-2-eth0.

8. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-10?**
   - Looking at the connections, Switch-2 has ports 1-24. Port 10 isn't listed. So nothing.

Wait, but let's check if any device is connected to Switch-2-port-10. The connections listed for Switch-2 are:

- NAS-eth1 → Switch-2-port-24 (connection 6)
- Workstation-1-eth0 → Switch-2-port-2 (9)
- Workstation-1-eth1 → Switch-2-port-3 (10)
- Workstation-2-eth0 → Switch-2-port-4 (11)
- Workstation-2-eth1 → Switch-2-port-5 (12)
- Workstation-3-eth0 → Switch-2-port-6 (13)
- Workstation-3-eth1 → Switch-2-port-7 (14)
- Switch-1-port-12 → Switch-2-port-12 (7)
- Switch-3-port-12 → Switch-2-port-12 (8)

So Switch-2-port-10 isn't connected to anything. So answer is nothing.

9. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-10?**
   - SBC-3-eth2 is connected to Switch-3-port-10 (connection 19). So answer is SBC-3-eth2.

10. **What is connected to Console-3-eth0?**
    - Connection 3: Switch-1-port-3.

11. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-3?**
    - Workstation-1-eth1 (connection 10) connects to Switch-2-port-3.

12. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-20?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

13. **What is connected to Switch-2-port-12?**
    - Switch-1-port-12 connects to Switch-2-port-12 (connection 7). So answer is Switch-1-port-12.

14. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-22?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

15. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-10?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

16. **What is connected to Workstation-1-eth1?**
    - Connection 10: Switch-2-port-3.

17. **What is connected to Workstation-1-eth0?**
    - Connection 9: Switch-2-port-2.

18. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-14?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

19. **What is connected to Switch-1-port-7?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

20. **What is connected to Switch-3-port-4?**
    - Not mentioned. So nothing.

Let me verify each answer again to ensure no mistakes.

1. Switch-3-port-21: Not connected. Correct.
2. Switch-1-port-18: Not connected. Correct.
3. Console-1-eth0: Switch-1-port-1. Correct.
