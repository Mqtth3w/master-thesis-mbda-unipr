Your task:
You will be given a network topology. Your job is to understand the structure and answer the questions that follow.
Use the format shown in the examples to give your answers, do not add additional information.

Naming rules: All components with numbers in their names (e.g., Console-1, Console-3) are distinct devices. The number is critical for identification.
- Multi-device components: Use '{device}-{device number}' (e.g., Console-3).
- Single device components: Use the base name (e.g., Server, Switch).
- Network interfaces: Append '-{interface}' (e.g., Workstation-1-eth0, NAS-eth1).
- Switch ports: Use '{Switch}-port-{port number}' (e.g., Switch-port-14, Switch-port-7).

Network components:
Switch with its own 24 ports, from 1 to 24.
Console-1, Console-2 and Console-3 each with its own network interface eth0.
Workstation-1, Workstation-2 each with their own network interfaces eth0 and eth1.
Server with its own network interface eth0.
NAS with its two network interfaces eth0 and eth1.

Network topology:
The Console-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-1.
The Console-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-2.
The Console-3-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-3.
The NAS-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-11.
The Workstation-1-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-12.
The Workstation-1-eth1 is connected to Switch-port-13.
The Workstation-2-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-14.
The Workstation-2-eth1 is connected to Switch-port-15.
The Server-eth0 is connected to Switch-port-24.
All unspecified device, ports and interfaces are not connected to any device.

Q&A examples:

Q: What is connected to Switch-port-17?
A: Workstation-3-eth1

Q: What is connected to NAS-eth1?
A: Nothing

Q: What is connected to Switch-port-23?
A: Nothing

Q: What is connected to Switch-port-14?
A: Workstation-2-eth0

Q: What is connected to Console-3-eth0?
A: Switch-port-3
