Tests rules:
- A '#' means that the test result is different from the expected value.
- A '*' means that the test result can be any value.
- If a test has a result that is different from what was expected, the test is 'FAIL', otherwise it is 'PASS'.
- If one of the test fields has the value '-' for example the error field, it means that there is nothing, there was no error in the execution of the test.
Below I show you the name of the test, the result, the report with the technical data and the error field according to the following format:
test{<name>},result{<result>},report{<report>},error{<error>},had_error{<if there was an error>}
